###  Which parts are within city limits?
- Comal River - All of it
- Guadalupe River - From Gruene Bridge to the Mill Dam

This is a city of New Braunfels ordinance. For the Guad, this means "that portion of the Guadalupe River that starts at the Gruene Bridge and ends at the Mill Dam." The Comal River starts and eventually flows into the Gaud all in New Braunfels.

### Does a can ban mean no alcohol?
Nope. You can still drink on the river, you just have to do a bit more planning.

<strong>Comal Pro Tip:</strong> Go to [Buckee's](https://goo.gl/maps/nJGXjoYbpND2) and get a reusable thermos. Fill that with your fountain drink of choice and add a dose of your favorite liquor for a sweet summer cocktail. It's a short enough float that a 32 oz. drink to sip should suffice.

Be a responsible adult, don't over-pour, and remember to hydrate.

### Definition of a disposable container
According to Sec. 86-14(a) of the New Braunfels city code of ordinances, <blockquote>Disposable container means a receptacle designed to be used once, then thrown away. For purposes of this subsection, disposable containers include, but are not limited to, metal and aluminum cans, glass containers, Styrofoam cups and containers, cardboard containers, paper sacks, boxes, paper napkins and towels, and plastic containers and utensils.</blockquote>

### Banned on all parts of both rivers
- Possession of open plastic containers of 5 oz. or less
- Styrofoam and glass
- LITTERING, obviously.


### What about River Rd. and the Horseshoe?
If you're camping or floating along River Rd. or the Horseshoe in Canyon Lake, the can ban does not pertain to that area.
