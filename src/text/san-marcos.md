###  Other rules to know in San Marcos

1. No public display of alcohol in city parks.

If you float in-town in San Marcos, through the Lion's Club or with your own tubes, you'll likely float by both City Park and Rio Vista Park. If you're partaking in river activities i.e. kayaking, tubing, etc., you can drink alcoholic beverages, but if you're drinking around the banks or on land and drinking, you could be fined.

The rule according to the [San Marcos municipal code](https://library.municode.com/tx/san_marcos/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=SPAGEOR_CH58PUFAPARE_ART2PA_S58.033PUDICOALBEPA) is as follows:

<blockquote>

It is unlawful for any person to publicly consume or display alcoholic beverages within a city park.

</blockquote>

The exception:

<blockquote>

Alcohol was consumed or displayed while conducting water activities that include but not limited to tubes, canoes, kayaks and within the river or waterway of city parks. Alcohol was consumed or displayed within a special event contract designated area of a rented pavilion, park, facility, or picnic tables, and the person is a part of the group that rented the area.

</blockquote>

2. Coolers must have secure lids.

This is just a good idea, no matter what river you float. The rule from
the City of San Marcos is as follows:

<blockquote>

It is unlawful to fail to secure the lid by strap, lock or other device to any ice chest, cooler, or other container designed for use to contain food or drink products while in use in or upon the San Marcos River.

</blockquote>

3. No glass.
4. No styrofoam.
5. No littering.



### Where to float in San Marcos

#### In-town

If you want a simple, family friendly float, there is a ~45min option from City Park to Rio Vista and you can rent tubes from the [Lions Club](http://www.tubesanmarcos.com/rental-rates.html).

#### Near Martindale off HWY 80

The floats here get a little more rowdy than in-town and are much longer. Don's Fish Camp and Texas State Tubes are two float companies that will shuttle you for these floats.
