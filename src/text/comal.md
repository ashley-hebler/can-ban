### Definition of a disposable container
According to Sec. 86-14(a) of the New Braunfels city code of ordinances, <blockquote>Disposable container means a receptacle designed to be used once, then thrown away. For purposes of this subsection, disposable containers include, but are not limited to, metal and aluminum cans, glass containers, Styrofoam cups and containers, cardboard containers, paper sacks, boxes, paper napkins and towels, and plastic containers and utensils.</blockquote>


### Also banned on the Comal
1. Possession of open plastic containers of 5 oz. or less
2. Styrofoam and glass
3. LITTERING, obviously.


### Does a can ban mean no alcohol?
Nope. You can still drink on the river, you just have to do a bit more planning.

<strong>Comal Pro Tip:</strong> Go to [Buckee's](https://goo.gl/maps/nJGXjoYbpND2) and get a reusable thermos. Fill that with your fountain drink of choice and add a dose of your favorite liquor for a sweet summer cocktail. It's a short enough float that a 32 oz. drink to sip should suffice.

Be a responsible adult, don't over-pour, and remember to hydrate.
